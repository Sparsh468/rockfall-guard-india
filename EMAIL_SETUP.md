# üìß Email Alert System Setup Guide

This guide will help you configure the email alert system for SHAIL KAVACH to send prediction results to logged-in users.

## üöÄ Quick Setup (Recommended)

### Option 1: EmailJS (Easiest Setup)

1. **Create EmailJS Account:**
   - Go to [https://www.emailjs.com/](https://www.emailjs.com/)
   - Sign up for a free account
   - Create a new service (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)

2. **Create Email Template:**
   - Go to Email Templates in your EmailJS dashboard
   - Create a new template with these variables:
     - `{{to_email}}` - Recipient email
     - `{{subject}}` - Email subject
     - `{{message}}` - Email content
     - `{{mine_name}}` - Mine name
     - `{{location}}` - Mine location
     - `{{risk_level}}` - Risk level
     - `{{risk_percentage}}` - Risk percentage

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in your project root:
   ```env
   VITE_EMAILJS_USER_ID=your_user_id_here
   VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id_here
   VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id_here
   ```

### Option 2: Webhook Service

1. **Set up a webhook endpoint** that accepts POST requests with:
   ```json
   {
     "to": "user@example.com",
     "subject": "Risk Alert",
     "html": "<html>...</html>",
     "text": "Plain text content",
     "priority": "high"
   }
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variable:**
   ```env
   VITE_EMAIL_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-webhook-service.com/send-email
   ```

### Option 3: HTTP Email Service

1. **Use services like:**
   - Formspree
   - Netlify Forms
   - Any email API service

2. **Configure Environment Variable:**
   ```env
   VITE_EMAIL_SERVICE_URL=https://your-email-service.com/api/send
   ```
